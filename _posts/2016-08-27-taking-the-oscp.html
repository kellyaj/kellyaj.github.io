<p>This weekend I registered to take the Offensive Security Certified Professional exam at the end of September. I will have 24 hours to compromise as many systems on the exam network as I can. I am also required to submit a report documenting my findings. I am thrilled but I am also expecting that it will be very difficult. I decided to write this blog post as a refresher and as part of my pre-exam review.</p>

<p>The OSCP labs are virtual networks populated with vulnerable machines running a wide range of operating systems and services. Students connect to the network and attempt to exploit lab computers using a variety of techniques. My lab time ran out about two months ago. I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of my lab time, there really is no such thing as enough of it.</p>

<p>A lot of useful information is collected while mapping a network and enumerating data from hosts. Keeping this information organized makes the exploitation phase go a lot smoother. Collecting a rich amount of data from a target is critical to compromising systems, but it has to be very intentional and well catalogued. A mountain of data does no good if its disorganized and incomprehensible. I wish I had been more disciplined in documenting my findings along the way. It takes discipline to slow down and organize findings or write reports when the thrill of getting a shell is so close.</p>

<p>Much like building software, breaking software requires a functional and comfortable work environment. Having my command line aliases, text editor dotfiles, and various other settings personalized on my VM made a huge difference in my productivity. I should have done all of that upfront or even prior to starting the course. I also felt a lot more confident once I had proper snapshots and backups, since there was less concern about getting my machine into a weird or irrepairable state.</p>
