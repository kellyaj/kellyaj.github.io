<h2>Password Hashes</h2>
<p>A hashing function is a one-way function that implements an algorithm that when given an arbitrary block of data returns a fixed-size bit string called a hash value. Systems that need to store passwords typically store the password hash values, rather than the passwords in clear text. During the authentication process, the password presented by the user is hashed compared with the previously stored message digest.</p>

<h2>Password Cracking</h2>
<p>Cracking is the process of recovering the clear text passphrase, given the stored hash. Once the hash type is known, a common method of cracking is to simulate the authentication process by repeatedly trying guesses for the password and comparing the newly generated hash with a stolen or dumped hash></p>
<p>It can be difficult to identify the exact type of hash unless you know the program that was used to create them. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The length of the hash (each hash function has a specific output length)</li>
  <li>The character set used in the hash</li>
  <li>Any special characters that might be present in the hash</li>
</ul>
